# My-Maps-L4D2
This is my maps of the game Left 4 Dead 2, so enjoy it

If you want to put this file in your Hammer world editor folder, do the following:

1-Download the attached file from my repository
2-Once downloaded, drag it to your game folder but in a specific area of the game folder
3-Attach it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steamsteamapps in the folder of the game itself 4-Open the authoring tools of L4D2 
5-Look for the folder and since you found the .vmf file then you can see all my maps.

Enjoy :)
